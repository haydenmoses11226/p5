			<p>I am Hayden Moses im am 21 years of age. I am currently participating in the OBT (opportunities for a better tomorrow) program. This program by far is a great program in helping people who qualify, start a new chapter in there life if they are going through hardships and obstacles in there life. Also this program teaches a web design and coding program and preps students how to behave and act in a work enviroment The program also features many resources available to everyone that may seem fit. I have found a great interest in coding and even though it is not my intended job or career choice, i do hope to use the skills I learned thougout this course to further develop and hone my skills for the work force.

			<p>Personal things about me that you may find interesting is that im a Introvert. I spend most of my time to myself and doing things that i enjoy. BUT, i am also very outgoing and friendly once i break my comfort zone. I attended kingsborough community college for a year and i am looking forward to re-attending college to finish my degree. I am a artist and aspiring graphic designer. I wish to increase my skills via pencil and paper and apply it to a computer or device capable of displaying what i can do, digitally. Overall i believe i have the skills and talent to be successful and with hard work and the proper resources, i intend to accomplish my goals!
